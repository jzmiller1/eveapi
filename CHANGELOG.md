Version: 1.3.0 - 27 May 2014

Version: 1.1.9 - 2 September 2011

  which now returns all data for members. [jehed]

Version: 1.1.0 - 15 Januari 2009
- Added Select() method to Rowset class. Using it avoids the creation of
  temporary row instances, speeding up iteration considerably.

  string objects.
- Added support for proxy servers. A proxy can be specified globally or
  per api connection instance. [suggestion by graalman]

Version: 1.0.7 - 14 November 2008

  is empty. [Flux/Entity]
